//! [`Perpl`] DEX SDK.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Convenient in-memory cache of on-chain exchange state.
//!
//! Use [`state::SnapshotBuilder`] to capture initial state snapshot, then
//! [`stream::raw`] to catch up with the recent state and keep snapshot
//! up to date.
//!
//! Use [`types::OrderRequest::builder`] to build an order from decimals in
//! human units - it quantizes them against the perpetual's own precision and
//! rejects what the exchange would - then [`types::OrderRequest::call`] for a
//! builder to simulate, send and wait on. Signing stays with the caller: the
//! SDK never holds a key, and leaves the sender for the provider's own fillers
//! to supply.
//!
//! [`types::OrderRequest::cancel`] and [`types::OrderRequest::change`] go the
//! same way, and read what the contract wants about a resting order off the
//! snapshot's own book rather than asking the caller to restate it.
//!
//! The deployed contract may lag behind the revision the SDK targets, so the
//! snapshot detects the contract's [`state::ContractFeatures`] and degrades
//! gracefully rather than failing on a missing selector.
//!
//! See `./tests` for examples.
//!
//! # Limitations/follow-ups
//!
//! * Funding events processing is to follow.
//!
//! * Current version relies on log polling to implement reliably continuous
//!   stream of events. Future versions could improve indexing latency by
//!   utilizing WebSocket subscriptions and/or Monad [`execution events`].
//!
//! * Test coverage is far below reasonable.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! | Feature | Default | Description |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `display` | yes | Enables [`std::fmt::Display`] implementation for state types. |
//! | `testing` | yes | Enables [`testing`] module. |
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! [`testing`] module provides a local testing environment with collateral
//! token and exchange smart contracts deployed.
