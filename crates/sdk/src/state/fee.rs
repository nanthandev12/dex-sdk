//! Keyed, tiered trading fee schedules.
//!
//! Since v1.1.7.4 fees are not a per-perpetual scalar pair but a *keyed
//! schedule*: eight `(taker, maker)` rates indexed by an account's fee tier.
//! Which schedule applies to a fill is selected by the perpetual's
//! [`FeeScheduleKey`] (exchange-wide default / RWA default / the perpetual's
//! own custom schedule); within it, the account's
//! [`crate::state::Account::fee_tier`] picks the tier, tier 0 being the base
//! rate.
//!
//! Both sides are resolved at fill time from the perpetual's current key and
//! the account's current tier - never snapshotted at order placement - so a
//! schedule, key or tier change takes effect on the next fill.
//!
//! The schedules themselves live exchange-wide in the [`FeeScheduleRegistry`],
//! independently of which contract points at which: rewriting a schedule
//! (`FeeScheduleSet`) and repointing a contract at one (`PerpFeeSchedIdSet`)
//! are separate operations on the contract and are kept separate here.
