//! Places, cancels and changes orders on a perpetual contract.
//!
//! These are the only commands that sign and submit a transaction, so they are
//! deliberately louder than the read commands: each resolves the signer's
//! exchange account, prints what it is about to do, simulates the call, and
//! asks before sending.
//!
//! The requests themselves are built, quantized, validated and submitted by
//! the SDK - see [`perpl_sdk::types::OrderRequestBuilder`] and
//! [`perpl_sdk::exec`]. What is left here is the terminal side of it: which
//! flag a fault names, what the operator is shown, and whether they agreed to
//! it. All three commands share one submission path, because to the exchange
//! they are the same operation with a different request type.
