# perpl-cli

Command line tool to read Perpl exchange state and events, and to place orders.

Every command but `order` is read-only and needs no keys or configuration. The
`order` commands sign and submit a transaction, so they need a private key. By
default the tool talks to Monad mainnet over a public RPC endpoint.

## Install

```bash
cargo install perpl-cli
```

## Usage

```
perpl-cli [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

Show the ten most recent trades on mainnet:

```bash
perpl-cli show trades
```

### Commands

- `block <BLOCK_NUMBER>`: Trace raw events from a particular block
- `order`: Place, cancel or change an order on a perpetual contract
    - `create`: Post a single order to the perpetual given by `--perp`
    - `cancel` (alias `delete`): Take a resting order off the book
    - `change` (alias `update`): Amend a resting order's price, size or expiry
- `show`: Show live state of account, perpetual order book or recent trades
    - `account`: Show account state
        - `--num-trades <N>`: Number of most recent trades to show, 0 to omit
          them [default: 10]
    - `book`: Show state of perpetual order book

### Options

These apply to every command.

- `--rpc <RPC>`: RPC endpoint to connect to [default: <https://rpc.monad.xyz> for
  mainnet, <https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz> for testnet]
- `--testnet`: Use testnet provider and contract addresses [default: mainnet]

  perpetuals for `snapshot`/`trace`/`show trades`, required for `show book` and
  `show mms`]
- `--highlight <ADDRESS or ACCOUNT_ID>`: Paint everything one account is behind
  on a contrasting background [default: no highlighting]

## Placing an order

`order create` posts one order to the perpetual named by `--perp`. It, `order
cancel` and `order change` are the only commands that sign a transaction.

Everything below the terminal - building the request, scaling it to the
perpetual's precision, rejecting what the exchange would, simulating and
submitting it - is the SDK's `types::OrderRequest` builders and `exec::Call`,
so every one of these commands can be driven from a program without going
through the CLI at all.

```bash
# Bid 0.001 BTC at 65432.1 on mainnet BTC, resting on the book
perpl-cli --perp 1 order create --private-key-path ~/.perpl/key \
  --type open-long --size 0.001 --price 65432.1
```

Price, size and leverage are given in human units - `65432.1`, not the
fixed-point integer the contract stores. Each perpetual carries its own price
and lot precision, and the value is scaled by that. A value finer than the
perpetual accepts is rejected rather than rounded, naming what it would have
become:

```
Error: --price 65432.123456 carries more precision than perpetual's 1 decimal
place(s) allows; it would become 65432.1
```

Before anything is signed the command prints the order it built and simulates
the call. A run without `--dry-run` then sends it; a run with `--dry-run` stops
there and prints the calldata.

There is deliberately no confirmation prompt between the simulation and the
send. The book moves between the two, so an order held open for someone to read
is an order simulated against state it will no longer meet by the time it
lands - the prompt would buy a false reassurance rather than a real check.
`--dry-run` is the deliberate look; a run without it is a deliberate send.

### Options

`order create` only. The flags every order command shares - the signing key,
`--request-id`, `--gas-limit` and `--dry-run` - are listed under
[Common to every order command](#common-to-every-order-command).

- `--type <open-long|open-short|close-long|close-short>`: Type of order to post.
  Named outright rather than inferred from a side and a reduce-only flag: the
  contract has no reduce-only flag, `close-long`/`close-short` *are* the
  reduce-only types, and inferring them hid the crossover - an *ask* is what
  reduces a long
- `--size <DECIMAL>`: Order size, in the perpetual's lot
  precision
- `--price <DECIMAL>`: Limit price, in the perpetual's price precision. Required
  even with `--ioc`, where it bounds how far the fill may run
- `--leverage <DECIMAL>`: Leverage to open at [default: the perpetual's maximum]
- `--post-only` / `--ioc` / `--fok`: Reject rather than take liquidity / cancel
  what does not fill immediately / fill in full or not at all
- `--expiry-block <BLOCK>`: Block the order expires at [default: never]
- `--max-matches <N>`: Maximum resting orders to match against, from 1 to 1000
  [default: 1000, the exchange's own cap]
- `--max-neg-pnl-collat-bps <BPS>`: Additional collateral, in basis points of
  notional, the exchange may draw to cover the position's negative unrealized
  PnL on a fill [default: 1000]
- `--builder-id <ID>` / `--builder-fee <DECIMAL>`: Attribute the order to a
  builder at that fee rate. Both are required together, and the deployed
  contract has to support builder attribution

## Cancelling an order

`order cancel`, aliased `delete`, takes a resting order off the book. It needs
nothing but the order's exchange ID, as `show book` reports it: the price and
size the contract wants come from the snapshot's own book entry for it.

```bash
perpl-cli --perp 1 order delete --private-key-path ~/.perpl/key --order-id 3
```

- `--order-id <ID>`: Exchange ID of the order to cancel

A cancellation is deliberately not blocked by a halted exchange or a paused
perpetual: getting out is not the same as getting in, so whether the contract
still accepts one is left to the contract.

## Changing an order

`order change`, aliased `update`, amends a resting order in place - one
operation where a cancel and a re-post is two, at roughly half the gas.
Whatever is not given keeps the value the order already has, so `--price` alone
moves an order and leaves its size where it was.

```bash
# Move order #3 to another level, keeping its size
perpl-cli --perp 1 order update --private-key-path ~/.perpl/key \
  --order-id 3 --price 65500

# Resize it in place, keeping its level
perpl-cli --perp 1 order update --private-key-path ~/.perpl/key \
  --order-id 3 --size 0.002
```

- `--order-id <ID>`: Exchange ID of the order to change
- `--price <DECIMAL>`: Price level to move it to [default: where it rests]
- `--size <DECIMAL>` : Resting size to amend it to [default:
  the size it has]
- `--expiry-block <BLOCK>`: Expiry block to set [default: the order's own].
  Required when the order has already expired

Sizing *down* keeps the order's queue priority; sizing up sends it to the back
of its level. The summary printed before signing shows each value the change
moves, so an amendment that in fact amends nothing reads as such - and an
amendment of nothing at all is refused rather than sent.

Close (reduce-only) orders cannot be changed, and an expired order needs
`--expiry-block`; both are the exchange's rules, reported before anything is
signed.

## Common to every order command

- `--request-id <ID>`: Client order ID to tag the request with. The exchange
  takes it as an idempotency key and wants it strictly increasing per account
  [default: derived from the current time]
- `--private-key-path <PATH>`: File to read the signing key from, whitespace
  trimmed. Takes precedence over the other two sources
- `--private-key <KEY>`: Key to sign with, or `PERPL_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `--last-exec-block <BLOCK>`: Last block the exchange may execute the request
  on, after which it is rejected rather than applied [default: no deadline].
  A guard on the *request*, not on the order it names: it stops a transaction
  that sat in the mempool from landing against a book that has moved on. Not to
  be confused with `--expiry-block`, which is how long an order rests once it
  is on the book
- `--gas-limit <GAS>`: Gas limit [default: estimated]
- `--dry-run`: Build and simulate, print what would be sent, then stop

### The signing key

Three sources, in precedence order: `--private-key-path`, then `--private-key`,
then `PERPL_PRIVATE_KEY`. The file wins outright rather than conflicting with
the others, because `PERPL_PRIVATE_KEY` is the sort of thing a shell profile
exports once - refusing to run whenever it happens to be set would make
`--private-key-path` unusable in the setup that most wants it.

```bash
# Best: the key never appears in argv or the environment
perpl-cli --perp 1 order create --private-key-path ~/.perpl/key \
  --type open-long --size 0.001 --price 65432.1
```

Prefer a file or the environment variable over `--private-key`: an argument is
visible to every other process on the machine through `ps`, and lands in shell
history.

The key is never rendered. It is held in a wrapper whose `Debug` and `Display`
both print `[redacted]`, so it cannot reach the terminal through a debug print
of the parsed arguments, a panic, an error chain, or `--help` with
`PERPL_PRIVATE_KEY` set. A key that fails to parse is reported without echoing
what was read.

The account must already exist: the exchange opens one on deposit, so deposit
collateral before placing a first order.

## Following one account

`--highlight` picks an account out of the output wherever it appears: the raw
and state events of `trace`, `block` and `tx`, the resting orders of `show book`
and `show mms`, and both sides of every fill in `show trades`.

```bash
# Watch one market maker work the BTC book
perpl-cli --perp 1 --highlight 4638 show book

# ... and see exactly which events in a block were theirs
perpl-cli --highlight 0x1234...abcd block 101375850
```

## Market maker analysis

`show mms` takes the accounts to track as `ACCOUNT[:LABEL]` pairs - an address
or an account ID, optionally labelled - repeated or comma-separated:

```bash
perpl-cli --perp 1 show mms 4638:Alpha 0x1234...abcd:Beta,5022
```

Each maker gets its own background colour, keyed by a legend, and its orders are
painted in it throughout the book below. Above the book sit two tables:

- **Resting quotes**, from the book as it stands: orders and price levels per
  side, size and its share of that side of the book, notional, the maker's own
  best bid and ask, the spread between them in basis points, how far from the
  mid its furthest quote rests, the size it keeps within 10 and 50 bps of the
  mid with its share of all the book's depth in that band, and the imbalance
  between its two sides. Closed by an `Others` row for
  the untracked remainder and a `Book` row for the whole book, so every share
  can be read against its total.
- **Activity** on that perpetual, accumulated from the event stream since the
  command started: maker and taker fills, each with their size, notional and
  fees, and the quotes placed, amended and cancelled - fills excluded, so the
  counts measure quote churn rather than trading.
