# Contributing to perpl-sdk

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the [Perpl](https://perpl.xyz) DEX SDK.

## Branching model

This repository uses an automated release flow, triggered by a merge into main.

| Branch | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `main` | Release branch. Every merge publishes to crates.io and cuts a GitHub release. |

### Pull requests must target `main`

> **All pull requests must be opened against `main`.**
> New prs must increment the version number.



This is enforced in CI, not just by convention. The `Check PR branch` step in
[`.github/workflows/pull_request.yaml`](.github/workflows/pull_request.yaml) fails the
build for any pull request whose version is the same as main:

### Workflow

1. Fork the repository (external contributors) or create a branch (maintainers).
2. Branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git switch -c feat/my-change origin/main
   ```
3. Make your change, keeping commits focused.
4. Run the local checks (see below) until they pass.
5. Push and open a pull request **into `main`**
6. Once approved and CI is green, a maintainer merges it into `main`, triggering an automated release to crates.io.

Branch names follow a `<type>/<short-description>` convention, e.g.
`feat/adding-order-from-cli-functionality`, `fix/premium-pnl-settlement`,
`chore/pinning-versions`.

## Prerequisites

* Rust >= 1.85.0 (the pinned toolchain is in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml))
* The nightly toolchain used for formatting: `nightly-2026-08-22`
  ```bash
  rustup toolchain install nightly-2026-08-22 --component rustfmt,clippy
  ```
* The `anvil` binary from
  [Monad's Foundry fork](https://github.com/category-labs/foundry/releases/tag/v1.5.0-monad.0.2.0)
  — this is a custom `anvil` build for Monad specifically, and the test suite needs it on
  your `PATH`.

## Local checks

Run these before pushing; CI runs the same targets.

```bash
make check   # cargo check
make fmt     # cargo +nightly-2026-08-22 fmt
make lint    # cargo clippy
make build   # cargo build --all-features
make test    # cargo test

make all     # convenience wrapper for all of the above
```

CI additionally runs [`cargo-machete`](https://github.com/bnjbvr/cargo-machete) to catch
unused dependencies, and `git diff --exit-code` after formatting — so **commit the result
of `make fmt`**, or CI will fail on a dirty tree.

## Commit messages

Follow the conventional-commit style already used in the history:

```
feat(A-1957): inconsistent-funding-start-for-new-perps
fix(SDK): pep-perp fee schedule tracking
chore: relist sol
```

Use `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, or `test`, with an optional scope — either
a crate (`sdk`, `cli`, `num`, `types::Trade`) or a ticket ID (`A-1957`).

Do not hand roll releases!

## Versioning and releases

* **Verify Expected Version Number** Ci enforces a difference in version number for any pr.
* **On push to `main`** — [`main.yaml`](.github/workflows/main.yaml) runs `cargo publish`
  and then `make release`, which tags `vX.Y.Z` and creates the GitHub release.

Because a merge into `main` publishes a crate version immediately, `main` is protected.

## Project layout

* [`crates/sdk`](crates/sdk/src/lib.rs) — SDK types for building and maintaining the
  in-memory cache of exchange state, plus order-posting helpers.
* [`crates/cli`](crates/cli/README.md) — CLI for reading and tracing exchange state and
  events.
* `crates/sdk/abi/` — contract ABIs consumed by the SDK. They live inside the crate
  so that `cargo package` includes them; `sol!` and `build.rs` cannot read files
  outside the published package.

Generate and browse the API docs with:

```bash
cargo doc -p perpl-sdk --no-deps --open
```
